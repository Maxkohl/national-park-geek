# national-park-geek

This project uses a Java Server Page front-end, Java back-end, Javascript and PostgreSQL to create a web application that allows users to get information about and vote for their favorite national parks. This project includes features such as weekly weather forecasts with advisories, the ability to leave a review for a national park and functioning rotating advertisements.
